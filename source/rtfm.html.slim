  According to Honda there’s no difference between the 2020 and 2021 year models ([source](https://www.hondaeforums.com/viewtopic.php?p=10857#p10857)).

  Some images appear to be broken in the 2021 manual, at least on Macs and in iOS.

  There is also an on-board manual in the car. Select "All Apps", then "Owner's manual". (#{link_to_manual 263}.)
