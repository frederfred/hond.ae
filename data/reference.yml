      - 16" wheels: 240 kPa / 2.4 bar / 35 psi ([source](https://www.hondaeforums.com/viewtopic.php?p=6291#p6291))
      - 17" wheels: 230 kPa / 2.3 bar / 33 psi (source: photo above)

      The pressure is the same front and back since the car has a 50/50 weight distribution.

      Recalibrate the tyre pressure warning system after changing the tyre pressure. Open the "Vehicle Settings" app, select "Deflation Warning System", then "Calibrate". Then drive for approximately 30 minutes (2020 manual, pp. 421–422).
