        Notes on some popular HDMI devices:

        - Google Chromecast: Can't stream from an iPhone while also using that iPhone as a hotspot. ([Source](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HondaeUK/posts/2981960938726042/).)
        - Roku: HD is enough; 4K is wasted on the car's 720p display. ([Source](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HondaeUK/posts/2981960938726042/?comment_id=2982281448693991).)
        - Amazon Firestick: HD is enough; 4K is wasted on the car's 720p display. ([Source](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HondaeUK/posts/2981960938726042/?comment_id=2985517711703698).)
        - [Apple Lightning Digital AV Adapter](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD826AM/A/lightning-digital-av-adapter) with iPhone: The phone needs to be tethered and can't be used for other things at the same time. Phone screen can't be turned off. Had letterboxing where Firestick didn't, and worse audio. CarPlay needs to be turned off while using.
